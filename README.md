# Skin Cancer Prediction
This project focuses on predicting skin cancer using a deep learning model implemented in TensorFlow. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and the Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss function.

**Overview**
Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancer globally, and early detection is crucial for successful treatment. Deep learning models offer promising results in medical image analysis, including skin cancer detection. This project utilizes TensorFlow and deep learning techniques to predict whether a given skin lesion is malignant or benign.

**Requirements**
To run the code in this project, you need the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x

Other necessary libraries, which can be installed via pip: pip install -r requirements.txt

**Dataset**
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of images of skin lesions. Ensure that you have a properly labeled dataset before running the code. You can obtain such datasets from medical imaging repositories or collaborate with medical professionals for data collection.

**Training**
To train the model:

Prepare your dataset, ensuring proper labeling of images.
Adjust hyperparameters as needed, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs, in the configuration file.
During training, the model parameters will be optimized using the Adam optimizer and the Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss function.

**Evaluation**
Once the model is trained, you can evaluate its performance:

Load the trained model weights.
Prepare a separate evaluation dataset, if not already split during training.
The evaluation script will output various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.

**Prediction**
After training and evaluating the model, you can use it for predicting whether a skin lesion is malignant or benign:

Load the trained model weights.
Provide the image of the skin lesion you want to predict.
The prediction script will output the model's prediction along with the confidence score.

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques for skin cancer prediction using TensorFlow. By leveraging the Adam optimizer and Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss function, the model aims to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between malignant and benign skin lesions. Further optimizations and improvements can be made to enhance the model's performance and usability in real-world scenarios.
